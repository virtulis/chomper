**Grab a piece of screen and display it in a always-on-top window.**

That's literally all it does but I've probably wasted more time each month switching between tabs and resizing windows than it took to code it.

Note: there is no delay so you probably should find a way to run it without using the terminal. Qmake will install a .desktop file so it will be added to menus and launchers.


```
qmake
make
sudo make install
```

There is zero more useful info [here](https://kludge.guru/chomper).
